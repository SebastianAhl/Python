Definition
> The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it refers to 
> methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many 
> objects or classes.

For example if three classes and three objects (car1, boat1, plane1) have a method with the same name, we can use it in a loop:
'''
for x in (car1, boat1, plane1):
  x.move()
'''
