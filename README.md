# Python
In the past I programmed a lot with python. Unfortunately it is a while ago and I forgot a lot or lets call it "it is buried in my mind"... So I just wanted to create a reference for myself and for whoever wants to use it too. 
Mostly it is filled with small programs to help myself to remember :-) So this repo is a knowledge database for me (or anybody else).
